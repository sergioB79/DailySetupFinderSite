#1. Macro Regime Snapshot (Today)
As of December 12, 2025, the global macro environment is characterized by divergent central bank policies, with the Federal Reserve maintaining a hawkish stance amidst persistent inflationary pressures, whereas the ECB and BOJ remain dovish due to weaker economic growth and subdued inflation. Commodity markets are experiencing volatility due to geopolitical tensions affecting supply chains. The risk sentiment is moderately risk-off, driven by uncertainties in global economic growth and geopolitical tensions. This is influencing FX markets, with safe-haven currencies like USD and JPY in focus.
