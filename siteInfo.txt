What we’re building

A cinematic, modern microsite that always loads the most recent report from your Google Drive folder and turns it into a high-end, interactive “macro experience” (not a dashboard).

Your report already has consistent semantic blocks (Snapshot → Key Forces → FX Implications → Risk Radar → What to Watch Next). For example: the “Macro Regime Snapshot — 2025-12-12 (Lisbon)” plus those sections appear clearly in the latest brief.

Objectives

Auto-ingest newest Drive file (no manual publish step).

Present the daily brief as:

Scrollytelling narrative

3D / motion-first “macro compass”

Elegant typography + ambient UI (museum-quality, not fintech SaaS)

Add “pro” usability without killing the vibe:

archive, search, diff vs yesterday, share links, export.

Audience

You + anyone you share it with (investors, friends, clients): wants clarity fast, but also “this looks insane” polish.

Mobile-first for consumption; desktop gets the full “wow mode.”

Data ingestion & parsing
Source

Google Drive folder: 1MMODjiYDGXbMDyE5VMwXf3v2yfbvIMLa

“Latest file” rule

List files in the folder, order by modifiedTime desc, take first.

Download file contents.

Parse into a structured JSON model.

Content model (derived from your report)

Your brief formats as headings + bullet blocks like:

Executive Snapshot bullets

Key Forces bullets

FX Implications bullets

Risk Radar bullets

What to Watch Next bullets

Normalized JSON (example)

{
  "asOf": "2025-12-12",
  "location": "Lisbon",
  "title": "Macro Regime Snapshot",
  "lede": ["Global policy divergence persists...", "..."],
  "sections": [
    { "id": "key-forces", "items": [{ "label": "Fed hawkishness", "text": "..." }] },
    { "id": "fx-implications", "items": [...] },
    { "id": "risk-radar", "items": [...] },
    { "id": "what-to-watch", "items": [...] }
  ]
}

Experience design: “WOW” moments (not charts-in-boxes)
1) The Macro Compass (hero)

A 3D orb/compass that visualizes the day’s regime:

Axes (inferred from text): Policy Divergence, Risk Tone, Commodity Volatility

The orb subtly shifts based on extracted signals (“hawkish”, “dovish”, “risk-off”, “safe haven”, etc.).
Tech: react-three-fiber + custom shaders, smooth camera choreography.

2) Scroll-driven narrative (“macro film”)

As you scroll:

Sections animate in as floating glass panels over an ambient background.

Key bullets become kinetic typography (think Apple event transitions, not slide bullets).

3) Semantic highlighting + “explain this” microinteractions

Hover/tap on phrases like “hawkish Fed” → see:

why it matters (1 sentence)

impacted assets (USD/EUR/JPY/gold)

“confidence” (based on signal density in text)

4) Diff mode (quietly powerful)

Toggle: Today vs Yesterday

Adds underlines and soft color shifts for changed bullets (no red/green screaming).

Great “pro” feature that still feels premium.

Architecture
Google Drive folder
   │
   │ (watch webhook OR cron poll)
   ▼
Ingestion service (serverless)
   - fetch latest file
   - parse markdown/text → JSON
   - store snapshot
   ▼
Storage
  - KV/Redis for “latest”
  - Postgres for archive + diffs
   ▼
Next.js Web App
  - loads latest instantly (SSR/edge)
  - renders 3D + scrollytelling UI

Two ingestion options

Simple + reliable: Vercel Cron (every 5–15 min) pulls latest.

Tech stack recommendations

Frontend

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript

Tailwind + shadcn/ui (for base components only)

Framer Motion (page + scroll choreography)

react-three-fiber + drei (3D hero + shaders)

Optional: Rive (ultra-polished micro animations)

Backend

Next.js Route Handlers (serverless)

Google Drive API (service account or OAuth)

Upstash Redis (latest snapshot cache)

Supabase Postgres (archive + diffs)

Parsing

remark/mdast for Markdown

simple “signal extraction” dictionary first (hawkish/dovish/risk-off/safe-haven, etc.)

later: embeddings for semantic search (optional)

Features & functionality (MVP → “WOW++”)
Phase	Features
MVP (fast)	Latest report view, beautiful typography, sections, archive list, shareable permalink
WOW (v1)	Macro Compass 3D hero, scrollytelling transitions, diff vs yesterday
WOW++	Semantic search, “topic map” view, export to PDF, alerts when regime changes
Timeline & phases (practical)

Phase 1 (2–4 days): ingestion + parsing + clean “magazine layout”

Phase 2 (4–7 days): 3D Macro Compass + scroll choreography

Phase 3 (3–5 days): archive + diff mode + performance polish

Phase 4 (optional): semantic search + topic clustering

Risks & mitigation

Drive auth complexity: start with service account + shared folder; fall back to OAuth if needed.

3D performance on mobile: “WOW mode” auto-dials down (static fallback, lower DPR).

Parsing brittleness if format changes: keep a tolerant parser (headings + lists) and log anomalies.S
